[[Terraform]]

A Hub-Spoke architecture is a common network topology used in cloud environments, including Microsoft Azure. It involves a central "hub" network connected to multiple "spoke" networks. This architecture provides a scalable and modular approach to network design, allowing for centralized management and control in the hub while enabling isolation and customization in the spokes. In the context of Terraform, you can use it to define and deploy such architectures.
