Apparently, LLMs still have some difficulty reading complex files, for example TTRPG sheets, I imagine due to lack of training with this type of data. A quick test was performed used the default PrivateGPT model and the result was that the model did not even managed to understand that the file had contents. Maybe different models can have a better performance, specially ones with a much bigger amount of parameters.
