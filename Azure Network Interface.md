  In Microsoft Azure, a Network Interface (NIC) is a fundamental component that connects a Virtual Machine (VM) to a [[Azure Virtual Network]] or the internet. It serves as the network interface card for a VM, providing network connectivity and enabling communication with other resources. To connect to the internet, a [[Azure IP Configuration]] configuration is necessary.
