At the moment, the only way that I discovered to develop tools for RRPG is by creating a Caracter Sheet with the code given. There is no actual open source on the project, and even the SDK appears to be some what limited (for example, there is no way to use Lua's io library).

For more information about RRPG plugin development, please check the following links:
