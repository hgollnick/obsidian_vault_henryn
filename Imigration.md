### Germany

Personal profile was created on Xing. It appears that the LinkedIn algorithm wasn't showing accurate results in regards to my search scope. Xing seems to be working better. In any case, I still need to improve my usage of it and fill more information on my profile. Currently waiting for some kind of response to the applications send.
