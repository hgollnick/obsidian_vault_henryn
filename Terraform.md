[[Terraform commands]]

Terraform is a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure in a declarative manner.

* What is the "versions.tf" file, and what are the "provider" and "required_providers" in there?
## Backend

The backend.tf file typically includes settings such as storage account details, container information, and other relevant details required for storing and managing the Terraform state in Azure.

`terraform {   backend "azurerm" {   } }`

- `terraform`: This block is used to configure global settings for Terraform.
    
- `backend "azurerm"`: This block specifies the backend configuration for storing the Terraform state, and in this case, it is configured to use the "azurerm" backend, which is designed for Microsoft Azure.
